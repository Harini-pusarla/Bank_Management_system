# Bank_Management_system

The Banking Management System is a console-based application developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It simulates basic banking operations and is designed to help users manage bank accounts securely and efficiently through a command-line interface.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The project aims to demonstrate the application of core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism by modeling real-world banking entities and operations in a modular and scalable manner.

## ðŸ”§ Core Functionalities
Account Creation: Users can create either a Savings or Current account with a unique account number.

Deposit & Withdrawal: Handles deposits and withdrawals while validating balances and input amounts.

Balance Inquiry: Allows users to view their current account balance at any time.

Data Persistence: Uses JSON file storage (accounts.json) to save account data for future access.

Menu-Driven UI: Interactive terminal interface for easy navigation and use.

## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Applied
Class & Object: Account, SavingsAccount, and CurrentAccount modeled as classes

Inheritance: Specialized account types extend the base Account class

Encapsulation: Account data is managed through class methods

Polymorphism: Different behaviors for account types can be implemented or extended
